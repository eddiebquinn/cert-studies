# Cert studies
These are the various notes I have for diffrent certifications. They have been made using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). Allot of certifications overlap in what they conver, so while each cert may have it's own MOC in the 'front matter' of all notes there should be a tag signifying what cert it is realted to.

## *note*
These notes are made given my current knowledge in mind, meaning some things will be left out. You are more than welcome to read and studying using these, but i fully encourage you to look at other sources in conunction with this
