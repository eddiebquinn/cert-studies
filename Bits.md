Bits are a type of data trasnfer using binary as the medium. This means the data is either a `1` or a `0`

## Bit manifestation under different [[Network topology|network toplogies]]
Each [[Network topology]] has a different way of representing these bits. The specific name for this is Transition Modulation, and this essentially means that under any given medium there will be a level of current/light that represents a 1, and a level that represents a 0. 

- [[Copper wire]] - Under this, the bit is transferred using electrical charge. When there is no charge this would be a `0`, when there is a charge this would be a `1`
- [[Fiber optic]] - Under this the bits are transferred using light, with no light being `0` and light being `1`
