This is where you use a single cable which runs the length of the network. Different devices that need to jack into that network would then tap into that network, using either a T connector or vampire tap. Bus topologies are very rare now days.

Bus topologies cause all the devices that exist on the cable to exist within a single collision domain. This is because if all the devices ant to talk on the cable at the same time, the data can collide.
