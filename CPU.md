## CPU Architecture
![[CPU_architecture_diagram.png]]

- Different CPUs have different architectures, and this architecture dictates what the CPU can do

### x86
- Sometimes called `IA-32`
- Developed by Intel
- Supports 8b, 16b, 32b instruction set
	- Can only run up to 32b programs
- Can only support up to 4GB of [[RAM]]

### x64
- Designed to expand [[#x86]]
- Can support 64b instruction set
- Can run both 32b or 64b programs

### ARM
- Advanced RISC machine
	- RISC - Reduced instruction set computing
- Used for low power devices like phones or tablets
	- Recently been used in apple M1 chips however
- + battery life & - heat
- RISC machines use a smaller amount of instructions to get the same tasks done
- Very likley to become more popular in the future
