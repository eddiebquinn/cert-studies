This is a network topology which offers full redundancy, because all devices are connected to one another. This has the added benefit that all devices have optimal routing. 

The main drawback of this approach is that it gets very expensive very quickly. Say you have a network with 5 nodes. In order to have full mesh in that network, you would need to have 5 network cards in every machine as well as five cables. Because of how expensive this gets, it is very rare that this is used - It is mainly used in very mission-critical networks, i.e. nuclear command and control. What is more likley to be used in day to day buisness is [[Partial-Mesh topology]].
