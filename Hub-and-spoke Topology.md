This is essentially similar to [[Star Topology]], but with [[WAN]] links instead of [[LAN]] connections. This is used for connecting up multiple sites. We call it a Hub and spoke because it works similar to an airline hub and spoke, meaning you have major highway connections between hubs, and those hubs serve connections to spokes. *In my personal opinion this is not a topology that builds on top of a [[Star Topology]], it connects two stars together.*

This is not redundant fully, because if one of the hubs fail, then you will lose a large portion of your network. However, it does offer more redundancy that just vanilla[[Star Topology| star]].
