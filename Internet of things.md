The internet of thing is basically everything - It is mainly referring to smart fridges, smart thermostats, etc. It refers to the phenomenon that most modern devices has some internet technology.

Security is a major issue in IOT

## Tech used by IOT
- [[WiFi|802.11]] -  This is Wi-Fi, can can operate in [[Instrastructure mode]] or [[Ad Hoc Wireless]]
- [[Bluetooth]] -  Bluetooth is often used for [[PAN]] communication, they are used because they are small, reliable, and use small amounts of energy
- [[RFID]] -  GThis stands for radio frequency ID
- [[NFC]] - This enables two devices to communicate within 4Â cm of each other, this is mainly used for pay
- [[IR]] - Infrared, this is mainly used in TV remotes. This is less used now days, but can still be used

These next two are very common specifically because of IOT devices
- [[Z-Wave]] -  This provides a short range, low latency data transfer between devices. It has the trade-off of slow transfer rates in exchange for low power draw. Z-Wave is mainly used for home automation.
- [[ANT+]] - This is mainly used for collection and transfer of sensor data, i.e. car tire pressure
