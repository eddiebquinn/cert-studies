It is important to establish that there are different types of meta-topologies
- **Physical Topology -** This is the physical framework of how things connect
- **Logical Topology -** This is the logical framework of how things connect

## Wired Topologies
- [[Bus Topology]] - One single cable connecting all devices
- [[Ring Topology]] - One ring connecting all devices
- [[Star Topology]] - Many devices connecting to one central switch/hub
- [[Hub-and-spoke Topology]] - Major hubs within the network, with offshoot spokes
- [[Full-Mesh topology]] - Full redundancy, all devices are connected to one another
- [[Partial-Mesh topology]] - Hybrid of Full-Mesh and Hub-and-spoke

## Wireless Topologies
Wireless does add three different modes that we need to understand
- [[Instrastructure mode]] - Uses a wireless AP as a centralized point and supports wireless security controls
- [[Ad Hoc Wireless]] - Decentralized wireless network
- [[Wireless Mesh]] - Multiple diffrent types of communication rammed into one network
