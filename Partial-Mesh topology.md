Cert MOCs: [[CompTIA Network+]]

This is essentially a hybrid of [[Full-Mesh topology]] and [[Hub-and-spoke Topology]]. It provides optimal routing between some sites, which all other sites being at most one node away. In order to get this right requires for a good survey to made, seeing where the busy sites are in order to establish your hubs.

This offers more redundancy than a traditional [[Hub-and-spoke Topology]].
