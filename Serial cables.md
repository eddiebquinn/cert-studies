#A-plus

## General info
- Connected to computers using a `DB-9` or `DB-25` (cables shown below)
![[db9_vs_db25.png]]
- Called serial cables they because they sent data in a single stream
- Generally measured in `b/ps` or `kb/s`
- Sometimes still found on old routers and switches 

## Disadvantages
- **Very slow -** Because data is sent in one stream, this causes the cable to be slow
- **One device per cable**
