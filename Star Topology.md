Cert MOCs: [[CompTIA Network+]]

---
This is where all machines talk to a central point, i.e. a network switch. This is the topology that is used in most modern day networks. 

The issue with this is that you have one central device, meaning if that device fails, then the network goes down. This major downfall was addressed in the [[Hub-and-spoke Topology]].
