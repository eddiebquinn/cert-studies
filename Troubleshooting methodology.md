Cert MOCs: [[CompTIA A+]]

---
As a tech, you're going to be asked to find the root cause, or at the very least find a workaround to get back up and running. For this reason, it is important to follow a standard procedure on troubleshooting to ensure that you and your colleges are able to pick up/leave off with troubleshooting. To help with this, CompTIA came up with a six-step methodology.

## The six steps
**1) Identify the problem** - Try and narrow down what the problem is, gather info from the user i.e. potential changes that have occurred.
**2) Establish a theory of probable cause -** Use the information gather in step one to establish what might cause the problem. This point may require internal or external research, i.e. using google
**3) Test the theory to determine the cause -** Step two allowed you to make your hypothesis, this is when you test your hypothesis e.g. if you think the issue if the computer wasn't plugged in properly, you unplug it and plug it back in to test it
**4) Establish a plan of action to resolve the problem and implement a solution -** Now you know the problem, you fix the system e.g. if your problem is a dodgy power outlet, create a work order to have it replaced
**5) Verify full system functionality -** Once the fix has been completed go over the system and perform tests to ensure that it's working properly. 
**6) Document findings/actions/outcome -** Make sure you leave a paper trial on what ou did and how you did it so other people are able to use that information in the future to mimic your solution
